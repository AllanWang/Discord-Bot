# Random

> RNG provider

* `!flip` - flip heads or tails. Optionally provide one of `h`, `heads`, `t`, or `tails` to mark a selection.
* `!roll` - roll a dice. Optionally provide two numbers to change the range (both inclusive). Eg `!roll 1 6`
If only one number is provided, the range will start with 1 and end with that number (`!roll 8` = `!roll 1 8`)
